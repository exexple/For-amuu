                            Hey amuu, i wish we could spend this new year together but it's alright, at least we have each other. i wish i could tell you how much i love you, how much you mean to me, how much i care and how much our bond truly matters. you know amuu, i used to think i was unlucky but ever since you I've started thinking that I'm the luckiest guy ever hehehe. I've started smiling, working harder, I've stopped overthinking (i mean atitau koru but komai koru atleast) ughhhh I can't even tell you how much i wanna talk about at this moment. i have a lot and i believe this simple card won't be enough, god i wish ami jate usorote thakilu hoi, i would've hugged you so tight my amuu. amuu, yeah that reminds me of that lovely name, amuu. how beautiful that is, it's not just beautiful, it's deep as well as it has such a deep meaning.

                            amuu, this name, the very name that i call you with is an abbreviation of amore, amore means love in Italian and that is why i call you that. Apart from that it also resembles muu, the nickname you gave me. ugghhhhhh i love that nickname, i love you, i love everything about you and i love everything related to you. you know amuu, it's amazing how we started. well it was such a story but god always kept us close and always showed us a way towards each other. all i want now is to stay with you till the day i die and live a happy and peaceful life where we'll live together as a happy family. a family where you, me, our parents and our lovely kids mayra and agastya would live together under the same roof hehehe. i just wanna stay with you forever and then die by your side while holding your hands. i wanna spend my entire life with you, i want you to be the first thing i look at whenever i wake up and the last thing i look at before sleeping.
